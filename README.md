DoctorGuardian

An app to
* search reliable info on medicine
* make sure only suitable medicine is returned
* ** it is available
* ** the restrictions do not contradict the patient's allergies and such

Use Cases:
As a user I want to get information about a medicine so I can save more time to be more attentionable for kids and parents needs



Ideas for future implementation:
** Build a social network around medicine, so doctors could comment around it.
** For example Doctros could share that lately some specific medicine is often forged (fake one), so other doctors could restrain from suggesting it to the pacients
